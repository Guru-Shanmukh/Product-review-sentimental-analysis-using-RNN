# Product-review-sentimental-analysis-using-RNN
• Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using RNN architecture.
• Preprocessed review data through tokenization, padding, and label encoding for effective model input.
• Trained the RNN model using Keras with LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies in text data.
• Evaluated the model with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, achieving 86% classification accuracy.
• Visualized training and validation metrics for performance monitoring and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
Tech: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLP.
